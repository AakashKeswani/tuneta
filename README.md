### Features

* Given OHLCV and return (X and y respectively), optimize technical indicator parameters to maximize correlation to return.  Multiple ranges can be defined to target specific periods of time.
* Select top indicators with most correlation to return with least correlation to each other with the goal of improving ML models with uncorrelated features
* Persists state to create identical indicators on multiple datasets
* Parallel processing
